                <p>
                    hey hey hey! i'm someone who's a bit all over the place.
                    i love all things tech, art, fashion, walkable cities, food, and so much more.
                    sometimes i feel like a sponge, going around and learning as much as i can from the amazing people around me &#129533;.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    i'm a serial hobby hopper, i dabble in the arts, i stay fit, and i'm currently on the quest for a perfect cup of coffee.
                    my existence in so many things really helped shape the learner that i am today, and the one i'll be tomorrow!
